A website and portfolio for a system that connects clients with service providers—similar to freelancing platforms—is currently under development and being completed. If anyone has suggestions for the remaining parts of the system, such as the customer-communication module for service providers or any other section that could make the platform more engaging, they are welcome to share their ideas. I can also grant access so they can continue building and improving it themselves.
